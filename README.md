Classification-Predicting Customer Churn
INTRODUCTION
Customer retention is an integral aspect of every business, and this strategy focuses on maintain existing customers. Today businesses depend on machine learning to predict if a customer will be retained or lost, this enables business owners to plan as to how to keep their existing customers and lure new customers.
In other to predict if customers will churn or not, a supervised learning approach known as Classification comes to play as it enables stakeholders to predict the future of the business ahead of time.

OBJECTIVES
The project aim is to develop a supervised machine learning model that analyse customer attrition in Vodafone.
The purpose of this project is to identify probable customer churn, offer insightful information about customer behaviour and create a proactive customer retention initiative.
The project's output will help Vodafone deal with customer turnover in a more knowledgeable and proactive manner.


HYPOTHESIS
With the initiative to find out if customer churn has a relationship with the contract type, these hypothesis statements were formulated.
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between customers churn and the type of contract.
Alternative Hypothesis:  There is a significant relationship between customers churn and the type of contract.
After the hypothesis testing was done, we failed to reject the Null Hypothesis since the P-value is more than 0.05. 

BUSINESS QUESTIONS
Below are the questions addressed based on the dataset:
1.What is the overall count of customers who have discontinues their services with the company?

2.Which contract type exhibits a higher number of customers who have left company?

3.How does the rate of customer churn change in relation to the duration of their subscription?

4. Is there a correlation between the total charge accrued by customers and the type of contract they have?

5.What are the preferred payment method?

DATASET 
The datasets used for this project were sourced from 3 different sources, i.e. github repository, OneDrive file, and an SQL database. Find below images of codes used in accessing the dataset:
